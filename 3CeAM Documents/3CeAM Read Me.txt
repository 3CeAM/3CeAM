===== 1. Welcome To 3CeAM =====
Hello and welcome to 3CeAM. Were very excited to bring you and everyone else something that
the community has been waiting for. The team put a lot of work into the project to make it
close to the official behavior of the 3rd jobs as possiable, while at the same time, provideing
a clean and stable program mod.

As some of you may allready know, 3CeAM was founded about 1 week after the Rune Knight and Arch Bishop
jobs were released to the RE test server. (December 24, 2008) When I started the project, I recruited
people into the project to help with the development. Some of those people are still in the team today.
However, during the development, we did some more recruiting and ended up running into problems.

Some of the people that were recruited did very little, or no work at all and used our work for their own
purposes. We had people try to steal, leech, mess up our work, and also try to take the code and pass
it off and take the credit for themselfs. We also had people repeatly try to buy the code from us. One
guy tried to buy it from me for $1,600. Then we ended up haveing people try to trick us into accidently
leaking info. Enough was enough.

Because of these problems, it was best to go into hideing. So around the 2nd week of May 2009, the topic
was closed and we never said another work about the project to the community. So it ended up looking like
the project died, yet it never died at all, nor did it ever come to a halt. During that time, we spent
a lot of our free time going to the RE server makeing charactors into 3rd jobs, testing skills up and down,
doing packet captures, learning about new features, and then takeing all the data collected and codeing it
into the eA program. it was a rough start in the beginning, but everything ended up going smoothly after.
One of the member even setup a test server for us to test our work on.

So your probely wondering why we have returned? Few reasons for this one, but I wont go into full detail here.
Mainly, a lot happened the pass few months and as time passed we ended up learning that it was just about time
that its best to make our first release since we perty much reached our goal.

So here we are. We hope that everyone will enjoy and have fun with what we have released for the community.

===== 2. What Is 3CeAM? =====
3CeAM (pronouced as "Three Ceam") stands for 3rd Class eAthena Mod. This project was designed to add the 3rd jobs
into the eAthena program, while also keeping the orginal mechanics. This means that none of the mechanics was changed.
So the jobs in this mod are running on the orginal Ragnarok mechanics thats been in the eAthena program since eA existed.

This mod also serves some other intresting purposes. One of them was the adding support for RE client. RE clients are
important since they give access to the newest sprites, skills, animations, interfeace and features, etc. We cant work
without them. Another purpose is to add some intresting features.

===== 3. Features =====
3CeAM comes with many features. Both features that can be used right now, and some that will be usable in the future.
So what all does 3CeAM come with? The mod adds the following features...

= Added 3rd Jobs
The main reason this project exists. Adds 3rd jobs along with skills, items, mounts, anything haveing to do with the
new jobs. However, their are no quest NPC's made for them as we dont know how to do the quest, nor can we read kroean.

= Added RE support
Another must. Diablo's RE support has been added to allow RE clients to work. Without this...well you wont beable to play
all of the new jobs properly. Plus we gotta test our work somehow. Also, full Captcha support has been added to work with
the latest clients.

= Added eA Code Cleanups
Some things in the eA code makes things difficult to do or figure out. So we cleaned and organized a few things.

Example: You want to use a command to change your job, but you sometimes might need the job ID. The average GM
will end up typeing "@jobchange" without anything after it to make the list of jobs and ID's appear. However, this list
is messy and at times can be annoying to find the ID you need. One of those cleanups provided with this mod replaces
that list with a totally redone list thats properly organizes each job and ID by categorys (Job type and branch) and all
in ID order.

= Added Support For Future Jobs
They may not be out yet, but the client supports them...well what exists of them. Support for the Gangsi, Death Knight
and Dark Collector jobs has been added. However, since the jobs havent been released, the support on them is very limited.
But when they do come out, youll beable to access them right away without needing to do anything to the code. Youll just
need the latest client that suports the new sprites when released.

= More information about all of these features and more can be found in the "3CeAM Documnents" folder.

===== 4. Things To Be Aware Of =====
Because these new jobs are orginally made for the use on renewal mechanics, we had to think about a few things
when working on this project. One of them was to stay true to the orginal RO mechanics and keep things ballanced.
Now in the old RO, max level and stats went up to 99 (counting just base stats). But the new jobs are made to go
up to base level 150 and max stats 120. Allowing it would create ballance issues. Below is info you must read before
setting up.

= Max Level and Stats
The max level and stats setting as been put at the orginal 99 to keep ballance
and preserve the concept of the orginal mechanics. Levels and stats over 99 are
a renewal thing and the orginal mechanics arnt ballanced for anything higher then 99.

A good example is the fact that you need 150 DEX to get instant casting. Imagine the
stats limit being 120??? Waaaaay to easy to get instant casting. Also, if base level
could go to 150, thats more stats to make it easier to max stats or bring all stats close to 99.

However, if you wish to raise these settings, you can. The MAX_LEVEL setting in
the map.h file has been set to 1000 so you can adjust your exp tables to allow up
to level 1000. Be sure to check out the exp.txt file in your database and scroll to
the bottom. All 3rd job base and job level limits are set there.

The stats limit is a bit different here. Go to the conf/battle/player.conf file
and look for this...

// Same as max_parameter, but for third classes.
// Note: Value must be equal to or higher then the value set for max_parameter.
max_third_parameter: 99

The max_parameter setting will still work as it allways did and is set to 99 and
work for novice, 1st, and 2nd jobs, as well as extended jobs.
The new setting above is to set the max stat limit for the 3rd jobs. This means you can for
example, set a stat limit for 1st and 2nd jobs, and allow a stat limit raise when a
player becomes a 3rd job.

Note: The max_third_parameter value MUST BE EUQAL OR HIGHER THEN THE max_parameter value.
Setting it lower then the max_parameter will prevent players from raiseing
their stats anymore once they change into a 3rd job.

Here's some recommanded info on how to use these settings for enjoyment.

Low Rate: 1x-25x
Strongly recommanded that your max level and stats are set to 99 if you
want the ballanced RO experience to remain in your server. Plus getting
levels after 99 will be too much of a pain for players.

Mid Rate: 26x-150x
Perty much the same as low rates, but it would probely be ok to set max level
to 150 and stat limit to 120. Depends in what your looking for in your server.
Just remember to be aware that allowing a stat limit that high will make it easier
to get instant casting.

High Rate: 151x-10,000x
The 150 level and 120 stat limit would for sure be ok in this area if the rates
are perty high. Some server may choose to change the required DEX need for instant
casting from what I know if their looking to keep cast times and cool downs ballanced.

Super High Rate: 10,001x and Higher
Rates this high...well everyone puts the limits up to really high settings.
Not really anything I can recommand here since its mainly big time PVP servers.

===== 5. Final Notes =====
To finish off, we would like everyone to try 3CeAM out, test it, and leave us feedback.
Feedback is very important as it can help us improve greatly. If you find a bug, report it to us.
But before you do, please make sure you can reproduce the bug before posting. You dont want to post a bug report
that you cant back up and may be false, do you?

Also if you have any questions, post them and well try our best to answer them when we get the chance.

Finally, if your looking to learn more about the project, features, and how things work, their's a
"3CeAM Documnents" folder with many documnents. Be sure to check that out.
