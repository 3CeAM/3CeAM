//Arch Bishop Skill Data, Info, and Progress....
//
//Info about skills. Not all of these lines will be used for each skill. Examples like if no bugs exist no bug lines will be placed....
//
//Formula = The official formula for the skill.
//
//Used Code = The used formula code in 3CeAM. The code should give the exact same results.
//
//Note = Any extra info to say about the skill will be listed here.
//
//Status = Lists if the skill is Uncoded, Unofficial, Mostly Working, or Completed.
//Uncoded - Skill has not been coded yet.
//Unofficial - Skill was coded, but is not officially coded. Could happen if lacking a lot of extra needed info.
//Bugged - If any known bugs exist thats causing issues, this will be marked.
//Mostly Working - Close to official, but formula is not exactly 100% accurate and/or missing some misc details. Chance of also being bugged, or may not be bugged to current info.
//Completed - Skill is 100% official and fully working.
//
//Bugs = Lists if any bugs are present with the current skill in 3CeAM if any.
//
//Note: skillratio always starts out at 100% damage by default. Also, damage will always be in a % ratio unless noted as a different type of damage. Like fixed amount for example.

Judex = 	Damage Ratio: 300, 320, 340, 360, 400

		Code Used: -- skillratio += 180 + 20 * skill_lv;
		if (skill_lv > 4) skillratio += 20;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Need to confirm if the splash around the target is 3x3 or 7x7.

Adoramus = 	Formula: -- 100 * (AB_ADORAMUS-LV-USED + 5)
		Status Chance: -- JobLV / 2 + 4 * AB_ADORAMUS-LV-USED
		Blind Duration: -- 5000 + 1000 * AB_ADORAMUS-LV-USED
		AGI Reduction Duration: -- 10000 + 5000 * AB_ADORAMUS-LV-USED
		AGI Reduction: -- 2 + AB_ADORAMUS-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 400 + 100 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Used Code 2: -- ????

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Having a bit of trouble finding the rate. Maybe im not looking properly.

Duple Light = 	Melee Formula: -- 100 + 10 * AB_DUPLELIGHT-LV-USED

		Magic Formula: -- 200 + 20 * AB_DUPLELIGHT-LV-USED

		Chance of Trigger: -- ????

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 10 * skill_lv;

		Used Code 2: -- skillratio += 100 + 20 * skill_lv;

		Status: Completed

		Note: The official trigger chance is in 3CeAM, but I forgot what it was and didnt feel like relooking it up.
