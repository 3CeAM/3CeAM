Questions Needing Answers For 2011 Updates....

Death Bound
Document says skill cooldown is 3 seconds, yet iRO's skill desc says you must wait 5 seconds before re-casting again.
Which is true?
Also says you cant move for the 2 second duration of the skill. How do I code that in?

Hundred Spear
Past info said that the player must master the Spear Boomerang for the autocast chance to work.
Yet iRO's skill desc says has a chance of activating the highest learned level of [Spear Boomerang] if the caster has learned that skill.
Which is true?

Wind Cutter
Whats the fear status duration?
Is the AoE size really 5x3 or is it 5x5?

Ignition Break
Is the bonus damage from having a fire element weapon equipt applied and affect by your base level, or its seprate?

Dragon Training
Document says size modifiers for spears is 100% for all sizes. Is it really 100% for small size or just medium and large sizes?

Dragon Howling
Is the fear status's immobilization 2 seconds reguardless of how I set fear's duration?

Rune Mastery
Success formula setup will need to be reworked or maybe entirely recoded since theirs much more to the success then just the skill level.
Will do this one day when I have time.

Millennium Shield
Says number of shields summoned: 2 shields at 50% chance, 3 shields at 30% chance, 4 shields at 20% chance.
I dont know if the way we have it coded makes the chances close to this. Right now its coded to work like this....
Chance to get 4 shields =  50% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 3 shields next.
Chance to get 3 shields =  80% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 2 shields next.
Chance to get 2 shields = 100%
Also says it stuns the player when 1 shield breaks. The stun lasts for 3 seconds and reduced by VIT right? Does this even work in 3CeAM?

Crush Strike
How do I code it as a self cast? I know how to make it self cast, but not how to apply damage through a status.
Guess ill do it like Exeed Break? I only updated the damage formula to official for now.

Refresh
The document doesent say it, but a tester found that it removes and immunes against Decrease AGI and Quagmire. It also worked on
White Imprison but not sure if it still does on it. Its been left in for now.

Vitality Activation
The disabled SP regen part is coded, but how do you code it to increase effectiveness of HP potions, heal skills
and lower effectiveness of SP recovery items?

Storm Blast
Document says nothing about a aftercast, yet past data showed it had a 1 second cooldown. Then again that aftercast found wasnt from kRO.
ill go by what the document said since other things in that old data was inaccurate like Earth Strain's item strip chance.

Fighting Spirit
The ASPD increase part was set to boost it by 2% * RK_RUNEMASTERY-LV-LEARNED as 10% will give a +4 increase to the base.
But I think the ASPD boost is only working if your in a party, which is incorrect as it should always work.
The code looks complex and im not bothering to fix it. Someone else can do that.
