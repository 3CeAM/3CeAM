Vulcan Arm = 	Formula: -- (BaseLv * (70 * NC_VULCANARM-LV-USED + Dex)) / 150.0

		Code Used: -- skillratio = 70 * skill_lv + sstatus->dex;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: -- Complete

Flame Launcher = Formula: -- 300 * (NC_FLAMELAUNCHER + 1) * BaseLv
		Full Formula: -- 300 * (NC_FLAMELAUNCHER-LV-USED + 1) ????
		Burning Chance: -- 50 + 10 * NC_FLAMELAUNCHER-LV-USED
		Burning Duration: -- 7000 * NC_FLAMELAUNCHER-LV-USED

		Code Used: -- skillratio += 200 + 300 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: -- Mostly Complete

		Note: Their's no way the full ratio is multiplyed by base level and thats it. It would be overpowered.
		Is the damage divided by 100 or 150 after that?

Cold Slower = 	Full Formula: -- 300 * (NC_COLDSLOWER-LV-USED + 1) * BaseLv / 150
		Chance of Frozen: -- 10 * NC_COLDSLOWER-LV-USED
		Chance of Freezeing: -- 20 + 10 * NC_COLDSLOWER-LV-USED

		Code Used: -- skillratio += 200 + 300 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Not sure where the duration times are.

Arms Cannon = 	Formula: -- Get read for this one. Its a big one.
		First 3 lines are formula that apply depending on the target's size. This will be refered to as SizeDamage and is a ratio.
		Size - Small -- (500 * NC_ARMSCANNON-LV-USED + 200) * BaseLv / 150
		Size - Medium -- (400 * NC_ARMSCANNON-LV-USED + 200) * BaseLv / 150
		Size - Large -- (300 * NC_ARMSCANNON-LV-USED + 200) * BaseLv / 150
		Formula: -- (in_CannonBallDamage + GetNormalAttackPower + GetPassiveSkillPlusAttackPower) * SizeDamage / 100
		Full Formula: -- Its hard to figure out when you look at more then just the SizeDamage.
		Note: The formula doesent sound right when thinking in a ratio percent. It might be additional damage in a fixed amount???
		Not bothering with this skill anymore until in-game testing can be done and I can get more details about it.

		Code Used: -- switch( tstatus->size )
		{
			case 0: skillratio += 100 + 500 * skill_lv; break;// Small
			case 1: skillratio += 100 + 400 * skill_lv; break;// Medium
			case 2: skillratio += 100 + 300 * skill_lv; break;// Large
		}
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Bugged

		Bugs: While the main ratio formula's are correct, their's some other stuff in the code that affects damage.
		CannonBallDamage....NormalAttackPower....PassiveSkillPlusAttackPower....and how does SizeDamage affect this?
		Is this damage from the above added fixed damage or does it combine with the SizeDamage somehow?
		Wont know exactly until actural tests can be done on a official server.

Acceleration =  Skill boosts movement speed, but I cant find how much. Probely the same amount as AGI UP gives.

		Status: Mostly Complete

Hovering = 	N/A

Front-Side Slide
Back-Side Slide = Code shows it checks your X/Y position when used and something about moveInfo.dir. Might be a similar check like what
		body relocation does???

		Status: Complete

Main Frame = 	N/A

Self Destruction = Formula: -- (NC_MAINFRAME-LV-LEARNED * NC_SELFDESTRUCTION-LV-USED * BaseLv * (CurrentSP + Vit)) / 150.0 + CurrentHP

		Code Used: -- 	md.damage = pc_checkskill(sd,NC_MAINFRAME) * skill_lv * (status_get_sp(src) + sstatus->vit);
		if (status_get_lv(src) > 100) md.damage = md.damage * s_level / 150;// Base level bonus.
		if (sd) md.damage = md.damage + status_get_hp(src);
		status_set_sp(src, 0, 0);

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Doing the math, I can see this is probely a misc damage skill. Also theirs some settings for this skill
		that we may need to set, but not until we can confirm things like if players can reduce taken damage somehow.

Emergency Cool = Believe it or not, but the use of Emergency Cool appears to reduce your current amount of heat by a set amount
		depending on how much heat buildup your mado currently has. Wont go into details with this one right now.

		Status: Bugged....Mostly Complete....Not Sure.

Infrared Scan = N/A

Analyze = 	Chance of Success: -- 30 + 12 * NC_ANALYZE-LV-USED
		DEF and MDEF reduction %: -- 14 * NC_ANALYZE-LV-USED

Magnetic Field = Time you cant move / Duration of AoE: 15000
		SP taken every 3 seconds when active: -- 40 + 10 * NC_MAGNETICFIELD-LV-USED
		Note: Does it also drain SP from the traped players?

Neutral Barrier = Says something like DEF_INC_Percent
		Clearly shows it increases DEF and MDEF by a percent.
		DEF/MDEF Increase: -- 10 + 5 * NC_NEUTRALBARRIER-LV-USED
		Note: Shows LifeTM + 10000 in the code.

Stealth Field = How many seconds you loose 3% SP: -- 6000 - 1000 * NC_NEUTRALBARRIER-LV-USED
		Note: Shows LifeTM + 10000 in the code.

Axe Training =  Axe / 2 Handed Axe Damage Increase: -- 5 * NC_TRAININGAXE-LV-LEARNED
		Axe / 2 Handed Axe HIT Increase: -- 3 * NC_TRAININGAXE-LV-LEARNED
		Mace / 2 Handed Mace Damage Increase: -- 4 * NC_TRAININGAXE-LV-LEARNED
		Mace / 2 Handed Mace HIT Increase: -- 2 * NC_TRAININGAXE-LV-LEARNED
		Note: The increased damage and HIT to maces should be the same as axes, but it says different in the code.
		ill just ignore what the code says and stick to the skill desc for now and recheck later.

		Status: Complete, but may be bugged with Maces.

Research Fire/Earth = Increase attack and resistance against Fire/Earth targets: -- 10 * NC_RESEARCHFE-LV-LEARNED

		Status: Complete


Axe Boomerang = Formula: -- 160 + 40 * NC_AXEBOOMERANG-LV-USED + Axe Weight
		Note: The skill desc says something like ATK 360% + Axe Weight. The Axe Weight has to affect the ratio since
		a straight added fixed damage from the axe weight would be very weak damage, even with 360% damage.
		When you think about, Axe Weight of 600 from a Doom Slayer would make it 960% damage if the weapon's weight
		increased the ratio.

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 60 + 40 * skill_lv;
		if( sd )
		{
			short index = sd->equip_index[EQI_HAND_R];
			if( index >= 0 && sd->inventory_data[index] && sd->inventory_data[index]->type == IT_WEAPON )
			skillratio += sd->inventory_data[index]->weight / 10;// Weight is divided by 10 since 10 weight in coding make 1 whole actural weight. [Rytech]
		}
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Complete

Power Swing = 	Formula: -- BaseLv * (Str + Dex) / 150.0 + 180 + 20 * NC_POWERSWING-LV-USED
		Auto Axe Boomerang Chance = 5%?

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 80 + 20 * skill_lv + sstatus->str + sstatus->dex;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: It checks the level of learned NC_AXEBOOMERANG. Currenty we have the autocast % chance set to 5% * NC_POWERSWING-LV-USED

Axe Tornado = 	Formula: -- BaseLv * (100 * (NC_AXETORNADO-LV-USED + 2) + Vit) / 100
		Consumed HP By Fixed Amount: -- 20 * NC_AXETORNADO-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 100 + 100 * skill_lv + sstatus->vit;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: If weapon is Wind element the entire damage is increased by 25%. I saw in a video the damage is done in 6 sub hits.
		May need to reconfirm if its really 6 hits.

Silver Sniper = FAW HP Formula: -- 12 * (25 * NC_SILVERSNIPER-LV-USED + BaseLv) + 3500
		Bonus Attack: -- 100 * (NC_SILVERSNIPER-LV-USED - 1)
		Duration For FAW Deplyment: -- 5000 + 5000 * NC_SILVERSNIPER-LV-USED

		Status: Bugged

		Bugs: Silver Sniper FAW's currently use the set HP from the monster database. Also shows it uses the skill NPC_REVENGE Lv 1.
		Set skill use conditions may be wrong. Can it really heal itself?

Magic Decoy = 	FAW HP Formula: -- 15 * (20 * (NC_MAGICDECOY-LV-USED + 5) + BaseLv)

		Status: Bugged

		Bugs: Magic Decoy FAW's currently use the set HP from the monster database.  Set skill use conditions may be wrong.
		Can it really heal itself?

FAW Removal = 	Note: Appears to have a percent success formula. Shows as this->m_characterInfo.clevel - CreateLevel + 50

		Status: Complete

		Note 2: Shows the players need to have item 6186 in inventory to use the skill. That item is a Monkey Wench. No wonder what this item was needed for.
