White Imprison = Formula: -- JobLv / 4 + 3 * WL_WHITEIMPRISON-LV-USED + 50

		Code Used: -- int rate = 50 + 3 * skilllv + s_job_level / 4;

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Bugs: Now that the success chance is official we need to figure out what the duration reduction formula really is.

Soul Expansion = Formula: -- ((100 * (WL_SOULEXPANSION-LV-USED + 4)) + Int) * BaseLv / 100.0

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 300 + 100 * skill_lv + sstatus->int_;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Completed

		Note: The part of the code that made it deal double damage on targets affect with White Imprison status was removed since
		the status itself is supposed to be handleing things like this. The status should double all Ghost element damage.

Frost Misty = 	Formula: -- (BaseLv / 100.0) * (100 * (WL_FROSTMISTY-LV-USED + 2)) + WaterInsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 100 + 100 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Freezing Chance: -- JobLv / 5 + 12 * WL_FROSTMISTY-LV-USED + 20

		Used Code 2: -- 20+12*skilllv+s_job_level/5

		Duration: -- (1000 * (30 - (Dex + Vit) / 20)) + 10000

		Used Code 3: -- tick -= 1000 * ((status->vit + status->dex) / 20);
		tick = max(tick,10000); // Minimum Duration 10s.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: The code is perty much complete. We just need to add in a check for Insignia's, but thats not until the Insignia
		skills are coded.

Jack Frost = 	Formula: -- If Not In Freezing = (100 * (WL_JACKFROST-LV-USED + 5)) * BaseLv / 150.0 + WaterInsigniaBonus
		Formula2: -- If In Freezing = (300 * WL_JACKFROST-LV-USED + 1000) * BaseLv / 100.0 + WaterInsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- 		struct status_change *tsc = status_get_sc(target);
		if( tsc && tsc->data[SC_FREEZING] )
		{
			skillratio += 900 + 300 * skill_lv;
			if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.
		}
		else
			skillratio += 400 + 100 * skill_lv;
			if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: The code is perty much complete. We just need to add in a check for Insignia's, but thats not until the Insignia
		skills are coded. Also need the Frozen chance.

Marsh of Abyss = Movement Reduction Formula: -- 40 + 10 * WL_MARSHOFABYSS-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- val = max( val, 40 + 10 * sc->data[SC_MARSHOFABYSS]->val1 );

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: I didnt look too deep into the official data for this one. I will another time. Theirs other reductions besides movement.

Recognized Spell = Status: Completed

Sienna Execrate = Formula: -- JobLv / 4 + 8 * WL_SIENNAEXECRATE-LV-USED + 40

		Used Code: -- 40 + 8 * skilllv + s_job_level / 4

		Duration: -- 8000 * 2000 * WL_SIENNAEXECRATE-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- (8+2*skilllv)*1000

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Is resistance the same like for Stone Curse?


Raidus = 	Status: -- Completed

Stasis = 	Duration: -- 10000 * WL_STASIS-LV-USED - 1000 * (dex + vit) / 20 + 10000

		Used Code: -- ????

		Status: Bugged

		Bugs: Its been a long time since this skill had a full field test and things may have been changed and/or fixed.
		According to the desc its supposed to stop the use of magic skills for anyone affected. However theirs currently
		skills in 3CeAM thats being blocked even tho their not magic type. Another bug is the duration. Turns out its partly
		hard coded, but also partly coded in a outside file in the official code. This is because the main duration is taken
		and reduced by a formula from players stats, while their's a extra +10000 seconds thats added at the end to prevent
		it from going below 10 seconds.

		I cant mark this skill as mostly working since its too buggy and far from officially working properly. Also their's other
		info that we may be lacking. This skill WAS coded at a time before their was any way to reduce the duration, so the current
		code is perty much outdated.

		Note: Duration cannot go below 10000

Drain Life = 	Formula: -- (Int + 200 * WL_DRAINLIFE-LV-USED) * BaseLv / 100.0

		Used Code: -- skillratio = 200 * skill_lv + sstatus->int_;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		HP Drain Chance: -- JobLv / 5 + 4 * WL_DRAINLIFE-LV-USED + 70

		Used Code 2: -- 70 + 4 * skilllv + s_job_level / 5;

		HP Drain Amount: -- (BaseLv / 100.0 * (8 * WL_DRAINLIFE-LV-USED)) / 100.0 * v26

		Used Code3: -- heal = 8 * skilllv;
		if( status_get_lv(src) > 100 ) heal = heal * status_get_lv(src) / 100;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: The percent of HP drain should be very close to official. Their was a small part of the code I couldnt figure out.
		Must recheck this later in the future.

Crimson Rock =  Formula: -- BaseLv / 100.0 * (300 * WL_CRIMSONROCK-LV-USED) + 1300.0 + FireInsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 1200 + 300 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete....I think.

		Note: The Stun chance and duration is the same as any regular stun from older skills right where the chance and duration
		is afffected by Vit right???

Hell Inferno =  Formula: -- 300 * WL_HELLINFERNO-LV-USED * Baselv / 100

		Used Code: -- 	if( s_ele == ELE_FIRE )
			skillratio = 60 * skill_lv;
		else
			skillratio = 240 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Burning Chance: -- 55 + 5 * WL_HELLINFERNO-LV-USED

		Duration: -- 10000 + 10000 * WL_HELLINFERNO-LV-USED

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: In the official code it shows the formula is the full 300 * Hell Inferno which make its 1500% for the full ratio.
		However it appears the damage is splitted between the fire damage and shadow damage by a percent. The fire damage is then
		dealed first, and then the shadow damage follows 200ms after the fire damage and hits with shadow damage.

		I will need to do some official testing to confirm the 2 hit attack thing and also see if its correct in 3CeAM.

Comet = 	Formula: -- Theirs 4 different damage formulas. The formula used depends on which of the 4 damage zones the player is standing in.
		Zone 1: -- 2500 + 500 * WL_COMET-LV-USED
		Zone 2: -- 1600 + 400 * WL_COMET-LV-USED
		Zone 3: -- 1200 + 300 * WL_COMET-LV-USED
		Zone 4: --  800 + 200 * WL_COMET-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- i = distance_xy(target->x, target->y, sc->comet_x, sc->comet_y);
		if( i < 2 ) skillratio = 2500 + 500 * skill_lv;
		else
		if( i < 4 ) skillratio = 1600 + 400 * skill_lv;
		else
		if( i < 6 ) skillratio = 1200 + 300 * skill_lv;
		else
		skillratio = 800 + 200 * skill_lv;

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: A few things needs confirm. Like is the burning chances 100% or set by skill level? Also I need to do some code rework later
		to make this a full AoE to use the dummy units so itl work official and be blocked by Land Protector. Finally the official code says
		its a 15x15 AoE, yet the animation is still the huge 27x27 its always been. Need to confirm if the AoE was reduced to 15x15.

		Note 2: Zone 1 = 1x1 - 3x3, Zone 2 = 5x5 - 7x7, Zone 3 = 9x9 - 11x11, Zone 4 = 13x13 - 15x15.

Chain Lightning = Note: Damage is controled by the attack version. See below.

Chain Lightning Attack = Formula: -- (BaseLv / 100.0) * (300 * WL_CHAINLIGHTNING-LV-USED + 200) + WindInsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 100 + 300 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: WL_CHAINLIGHTNING_ATK has the same number of levels as WL_CHAINLIGHTNING, but the level used really depends on what level of
		WL_CHAINLIGHTNING that the caster used.

		Note2: If im correct, the code says the attack hits or chains to the next target every .650 (which is 650) seconds.

Earth Strain =  Formula: -- (BaseLv / 100.0) * (100 * (WL_EARTHSTRAIN-LV-USED + 20)) + EarthInsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 1900 + 100 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Strip Chance: -- 6 * WL_EARTHSTRAIN-LV-USED + JobLv / 4 + Dex / 10

		Used Code: -- rate = 6 * skilllv + sstatus->dex / 10 + s_job_level / 4 - tstatus->dex /5;

		Status: -- Mostly Complete

		Note: The tstatus->dex / 5 part in the strip code is unofficial, but players gotta have some kind of way to have resistance.
		I dont know the official strip resistance yet, so this will have to do for now.

		Note 2: Think the duration of the strip is ether 20000 or 60000. Cant figure it out.

		Note 3: I see attack motion in here and think the speed of the AoE stepping is your ASPD???

Tetra Vortex
Tetra Vortex Fire
Tetra Vortex Water
Tetra Vortex Wind
Tetra Vortex Earth =  Full Formula: -- 500 + 500 * WL_TETRAVORTEX-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 400 + 500 * skill_lv

		Status: Bugged

		Bug: Currently the WL_TETRAVORTEX ID is doing all the work and the other 4 are no longer used....for now.
		This WAS normal when Gravity recoded the skill to allow you to set what element each strike will be. However,
		that changed a few months ago when the original ID's that did the damage was given animations. Now all of them are used.
		The skill will have to be partly recoded to use these ID's to match the animations and official workings. Without that setup,
		the earth element will not properly unhide/uncloak hidden players and enemys.

Summon Fire Ball
Summon Lightning Ball
Summon Water Ball
Summon Stone =  Note: Each element sphere takes 1 SP every 1 (1000) second.

Summon Attack Fire
Summon Attack Wind
Summon Attack Water
Summon Attack Earth = Formula: -- (((WL_SUMMON_ATK-LV-USED - ????) >> 1????) * (BaseLv + JobLv)) * BaseLv / 100.0 + InsigniaBonus

		Used Code: -- skillratio = skill_lv * (s_level + s_job_level);
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Because I was unable to fully understand the first part of the formula, I used what I thought it could be.
		If the formula is like BaseRatio * (BaseLv + JobLv), then something like the old 50 + 50 * skilllv would make the skill
		insanely overpowered. Doing skill level times base and job levels combined sounded right as its not overpowered. I still
		need a confirm on this before marking it as completed.

Release = 	Note: Appears to release spheres at the speed of your ASPD since GetAttackMotionTime is in here.

		Status: Completed

Reading Spellbook = Status: Completed

Freezing Spell = Formula: -- BaseLv / 10 + Int / 10 + 4 * WL_FREEZE_SP-LV-LEARNED

		Used Code: -- 4 * pc_checkskill(sd,WL_FREEZE_SP) + sstatus->int_ / 10 + sd->status.base_level / 10

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Why did I find 2 max_preserve amount formula's and checks in the code???

		Note2: Preserved spells drain SP every 10 (10000) seconds. Amount of SP each preserved skill takes
		per 10 seconds is 24 - 4 * WL_FREEZE_SP-LV-LEARNED. Current amount in 3CeAM's code may be incorrect.
