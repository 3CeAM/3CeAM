	* Added rewritten Arch Bishop and Warlock skills to the trunk/rewrite folder.
	- Things missing: Editted item_db.txt with support for third class bitmasks.
		Current job system of stable/r13890, which is cleaner and more functional.
	- BEWARE! Everything in the trunk folder should be used for testing purposes only,
		though we do need your help reporting any bugs you might find so we can merge it to
		their respective /stable folder.
	- item_db.txt is not yet editted for items to work with third class characters. Please bear with me.
