//Value A is a normal value affected by B. Value B works similar to value A, but is multiplied by the
//level of EDP used. Value C sets if value B will be added to or stract value A. For example
//if I set A as 300, B as 50, and C as 1, The damage increase formula will be 300 + 50 * Skill Level.
//If I set value C as 0, itl change to 300 - 50 * Skill Level. You can set C to 1 and use A or B alone as well
//by setting the unused A or B value to 0. You can also set A and B to 0 to make EDP have no effect on Guillotine skills.
//Note: Default setting in ABC order is 0 / 20 / 1 which makes EDP boost damage by 20% each level up to double damage at max level.
//This is set like this for balance reasons. However your free to adjust this to whatever you feel is balanced.
