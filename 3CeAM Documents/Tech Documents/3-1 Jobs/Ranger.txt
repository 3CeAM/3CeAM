//Info about skills. Not all of these lines will be used for each skill. Examples like if no bugs exist no bug lines will be placed....
//
//Formula = The official formula for the skill.
//
//Used Code = The used formula code in 3CeAM. The code should give the exact same results.
//
//Note = Any extra info to say about the skill will be listed here.
//
//Status = Lists if the skill is Uncoded, Unofficial, Mostly Working, or Completed.
//Uncoded - Skill has not been coded yet.
//Unofficial - Skill was coded, but is not officially coded. Could happen if lacking a lot of extra needed info.
//Bugged - If any known bugs exist thats causing issues, this will be marked.
//Mostly Working - Close to official, but formula is not exactly 100% accurate and/or missing some misc details. Chance of also being bugged, or may not be bugged to current info.
//Completed - Skill is 100% official and fully working.
//
//Bugs = Lists if any bugs are present with the current skill in 3CeAM if any.
//
//Note: skillratio always starts out at 100% damage by default. Also, damage will always be in a % ratio unless noted as a different type of damage. Like fixed amount for example.

Arrow Storm = 	Formula: -- 200 + 50 * RA_ARROWSTORM-LV-USED

		Code Used: -- skillratio += 100 + 50 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly COmplete

		Note: Even tho the code doesent show any increase by base level, its thought that it has it in more up-to-date code.

Fear Breeze = 	Note: As complex as this skill kinda is right now, im not bothering with this one, but think it works as should.

		Status: Mostly Working

		Note: I think the number of hits it does by chance is the same way Millenium Shield's chance setup is.

Ranger Main = 	Increased damage and resistance on Brute, Insect, and Fish: -- 5 * RA_RANGERMAIN-LV-USED

		Code Used: -- if( (skill = pc_checkskill(sd, RA_RANGERMAIN)) > 0 && (status->race == RC_BRUTE || status->race == RC_PLANT || status->race == RC_FISH) )
				damage += (skill * 5);

		Code Used 2: -- if( src->type == BL_MOB && (skill=pc_checkskill(tsd,RA_RANGERMAIN))>0 && 
					(sstatus->race == RC_BRUTE || sstatus->race == RC_FISH || sstatus->race == RC_PLANT) )
					vit_def += skill*5;

		Status: Complete

Aimed Bolt = 	Formula: -- 500 + 50 * RA_AIMEDBOLT-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 400 + 50 * skill_lv;
				if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.
				if( tsc && (tsc->data[SC_BITE] || tsc->data[SC_ANKLE] || tsc->data[SC_ELECTRICSHOCKER]) )
					wd.div_ = tstatus->size + 2 + rand()%2;

Cluster Bomb =  Full Ratio Formula: -- 200 + 100 * RA_CLUSTERBOMB-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 100 + 100 * skill_lv

		Full Fixed Formula: -- 40 * RA_RESEARCHTRAP-LV-LEARNED + (5 * Int) + ((2 * RA_CLUSTERBOMB-LV-USED * (Dex + 100)) * (BaseLv / 100.0 + 1.5))

		Used Code 2: -- md.damage = (2 * skill_lv * (sstatus->dex + 100));
		md.damage = md.damage * 2;// Without BaseLv Bonus
		md.damage = md.damage + (5 * sstatus->int_) + (40 * pc_checkskill(sd,RA_RESEARCHTRAP));

		Status: Bugged

		Bugs: The skill is dealing strange damage that is somehow hitting multiple times all at once when multiple monsters are close to each other.
		The more monsters hit, the more damage thats dealed. This bug should be found and fixed due to it being a damage exploit.

		Status: Complete

Warg Dash = 	Formula: -- Do I really have to give a full formula here? Ok. 300 * RA_WUGDASH-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio = 500;

		Status: Mostly Complete

		Note: Says 300 in the code, but says 600 on the wiki, BUT says the damage calculation is bugged. So whats the real ratio?
