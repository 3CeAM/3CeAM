//the damage is increased in a renewal EDP way. This doesn't affect assassin skills in any way.
//
//The formula is like this....(A) (C) (B) * EDP Skill Level. Value A and B have a max setable value between
//0 and 1000. Value C is setable to 0 or 1 which sets how B will affect A. Value of 0 is - and 1 is +.
//Value A is a normal value affected by B. Value B works similar to value A, but is multiplied by the
//level of EDP used. Value C sets if value B will be added to or stract value A. For example
//if I set A as 300, B as 50, and C as 1, The damage increase formula will be 300 + 50 * Skill Level.
//If I set value C as 0, itl change to 300 - 50 * Skill Level. You can set C to 1 and use A or B alone as well
//by setting the unused A or B value to 0. You can also set A and B to 0 to make EDP have no effect on Guillotine skills.
//Note: Default setting in ABC order is 0 / 20 / 1 which makes EDP boost damage by 20% each level up to double damage at max level.
//This is set like this for balance reasons. However your free to adjust this to whatever you feel is balanced.
//Normal EDP settings would be 50 / 50 / 1.
