//Info about skills. Not all of these lines will be used for each skill. Examples like if no bugs exist no bug lines will be placed....
//
//Formula = The official formula for the skill.
//
//Used Code = The used formula code in 3CeAM. The code should give the exact same results.
//
//Note = Any extra info to say about the skill will be listed here.
//
//Status = Lists if the skill is Uncoded, Unofficial, Mostly Working, or Completed.
//Uncoded - Skill has not been coded yet.
//Unofficial - Skill was coded, but is not officially coded. Could happen if lacking a lot of extra needed info.
//Bugged - If any known bugs exist thats causing issues, this will be marked.
//Mostly Working - Close to official, but formula is not exactly 100% accurate and/or missing some misc details. Chance of also being bugged, or may not be bugged to current info.
//Completed - Skill is 100% official and fully working.
//
//Bugs = Lists if any bugs are present with the current skill in 3CeAM if any.
//
//Note: skillratio always starts out at 100% damage by default. Also, damage will always be in a % ratio unless noted as a different type of damage. Like fixed amount for example.

Enchant Blade = Formula: -- 20 * (RK_ENCHANTBLADE-LV-USED + 5) + BaseLv / 10 + Int + MATK

		Used Code: -- 100+20*skilllv+sstatus->int_/2+status_get_lv(bl)/10

		Note: The main MATK part is controled in battle.c as if its a full magic attack as well. The above formula is just added in after as a fixed amount.
		Status: Completed

Sonic Wave = 	Formula: -- 500 + 100 * RK_SONICWAVE-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 400 + 100 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Note: I didnt see anything about base level increasing damage, but then again I could find the call for getting the ratio.
		So info on the iRO Wiki Forums most likly correct.
		Status: Completed

Death Bound = 	Formula: -- ((500 + 100 * RK_DEATHBOUND-LV-USED) * BaseLv) / 100

		Used Code: -- ????

		Note: Their appears to be some other formulas in the code as well. Maybe how much percent to reflect back at the attacker and how much you receive???
		Also need to test if your base level really does affect how much the damaged is increased.
		Status: Unofficial and Bugged
		Bug: Amount reflected at target and how much you receive may be incorrect since I found other formulas for those parts. Also ive herd its difficult to
		trigger the skill when used and waiting for a enemy. Is it correctly checking for the pos of the attacker and direction your facing like how Auto COunter works?

Hundred Spear = Formula: -- ((BaseLv - 100) / 200.0 + 1.0) * (40 * (RK_HUNDREDSPEAR-LV-USED + 15))

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 500 + 40 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Completed

Wind Cutter = 	Formula: -- 100 + 50 * RK_WINDCUTTER-LV-USED

		Used Code: -- skillratio += 50 * skill_lv;
		if( s_level > 50 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 50) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Completed

Ignition Break = Formula: -- Damage split into 3 formulas for each range zone...
		Inner Zone -- (200 * RK_IGNITIONBREAK-LV-USED + 200) * ((BaseLv - 100) / 200.0 + 1.0)
		Middle Zone - (200 * RK_IGNITIONBREAK-LV-USED + 100) * ((BaseLv - 100) / 200.0 + 1.0)
		Outer Zone -- 100 * (RK_IGNITIONBREAK-LV-USED + 1) * ((BaseLv - 100) / 200.0 + 1.0)
		If Weapon Is Fire Element -- Damage-Formula * 1.5

		Used Code: -- i = distance_bl(src,target);
		skillratio += 100 * skill_lv;
		if( i < 4 ) skillratio += 100 * skill_lv;
		if( i < 2 ) skillratio += 100;
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.
		if( sstatus->rhw.ele == ELE_FIRE )	skillratio +=  skillratio / 2;	// Bonus by fire element endow.

		Status: Completed

Dragon Training = Status: Completed

Dragon Breath = Formula: -- (CurrentHP / 50 + MaxSP / 4) * (RK_DRAGONBREATH-LV-USED * BaseLv) / 150.0 * (100 + 5 * (RK_DRAGONTRAINING-LV-LEARNED - 1)) / 100.0

		Code Used: -- md.damage = ((status_get_hp(src) / 50) + (status_get_max_sp(src) / 4)) * skill_lv;
		if (status_get_lv(src) > 100) md.damage = md.damage * s_level / 150;// Base level bonus.
		if (sd) md.damage = md.damage * (100 + 5 * (pc_checkskill(sd,RK_DRAGONTRAINING) - 1)) / 100;

		Status: Mostly Working

		Bugs: Dragon Breath is a tricky skill to code. Theirs reports of many random things like what reduces its damage, what blocks it, what can affect the damage,
		etc. A good bit of research, coding, and testing will need to be done to get this skill official. At least the above formula is finally officially coded in.

Dragon Howling = Formula: -- 50 + 6 * RK_DRAGONHOWLING-LV-USED

		Used Code: 50 + 6 * skilllv

		Status: Completed

		Note: May have to test if the Fear status is working as it should.

Rune Mastery =  Status: Mostly Working

		Note: The success chances needs to be fully rechecked as they might not entirely be official.

Millenium Shield = Formula: -- The % chance of getting a certain number of shields works as follow...
			Chance to get 4 shields =  50% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 3 shields next.
			Chance to get 3 shields =  80% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 2 shields next.
			Chance to get 2 shields = 100%
			Each shield has 1000 HP???

		Used Code: -- short shields = short shields = (rand()%100<50) ? 4 : ((rand()%100<80) ? 3 : 2);
		sc_start4(bl,type,100,skilllv,shields,1000,0,skill_get_time(skillid,skilllv));

		Status: Complete

		Note: Is the shields fully blocking attacks even if they deal more damage then the HP of the shield? Must Test

Crush Strike =  Formula: -- WeaponATK + 100 * WeaponLevel * (RefineLevel + 6)

		Used Code: -- skillratio = sstatus->rhw.atk + 100 * sd->inventory_data[index]->wlv * (sd->status.inventory[index].refine + 6);

		Status: Mostly Working

		Bugs: While the formula is now official, we need to confirm if ATK% cards, Race% cards, and other similars work with this skill.
		With it being so powering and throwing all damage in on 1 hit this must be tested soon.

Refresh = 	N/A

Giant Growth =  N/A

Stone Hard Skin = Note: Shows in the official code that it takes 20% of your current HP while 3CeAM's code takes 25% as outside sources say it should.
		Theirs also what appears to be a set % chance of breaking a enemys weapon which is 30% and is the same % chance for lowering a attacking mosnters attack.

Vitality Activation = N/A

Storm Blast = 	Formula: -- ???? (Code isnt showing it properly)

		Used Code: -- skillratio = 100 * (sd ? pc_checkskill(sd,RK_RUNEMASTERY) : 1) +  100 * (sstatus->int_ / 4);

		Status: Mostly Working

		Note: The formula provided by the community is close to official, but were not sure how much since were not able to see the official one in the code.

Fighting Spirit = Note: The formula for how the number of party members affects this skill is hard to understand and im not bothering with this one.

Abundance = 	N/A

Phantom Thrust = Formula: -- (10 * (KN_SPEARMASTERY-LV-LEARNED + 5 * RK_PHANTOMTHRUST-LV-USED)) * BaseLv / 150.0

		Used Code: -- skillratio = 50 * skill_lv + 10 * pc_checkskill(sd,KN_SPEARMASTERY);
		if( s_level > 100 ) skillratio += skillratio * (s_level - 100) / 200;	// Base level bonus.

		Status: Mostly Working

		Bugs: While it says the damage is Damage * BaseLv / 150, I left the (s_level - 100) / 200 code since the official one would force
		a level 100 player using level 1 of this skill to deal 33% damage which just insanely low.
