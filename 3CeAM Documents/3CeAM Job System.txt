===== 1. 3CeAM 3rd Jobs and Job System =====
This will fully explain how the job system works in 3CeAM in full detail. If you want a short explaining, just go to
chapter 2.

3CeAM currently adds support for all 12 jobs (13 if you count the split between Minstrel/Wanderer), as well as both
versions for each job. What do we mean by versions your wondering??? Well, what job you are when your changeing to a
3rd job will determand which of the 2 versions youll become. Before going any further, lets go over how the server
handles the jobs. Well be focusing on the paths of regular jobs.

The way jobs work is that its kinda like a tree, and the path you choose determands which direction you will walk, and
you will keep on walking until you reach the end of one of the tree's branches. When you start, you start off as a novice
at the bottom of the tree. After you kill a few things, you get to choose one of the 6 regular jobs...Swordman, Mage,
Archer, Acolyte, Merchant, and Thief. Once you do, you start walking your path.

Novice and all 1st jobs are marked as base jobs in the system, or the "root" as you may call it. Also note that all jobs
are assigned a MAPID in the server to help arrange them better in the system. These base jobs are recognized by the server
by reading the last 2 hex digits of your job's MAPID. Lets choose to walk the path of the Swordman. Your MAPID gets changed
0x01. Remember that this value is different for each base job. So now were a Swordman and we kill and level for a while,
and its now time to get our 2nd job. Once again you have more then 1 choice for your next job.

This time you have a choice of 2 jobs. What your 1st job is determands what 2 jobs youll have to choose from. The choice
between the 2 jobs youll beable to choose from are jobs that will behave kinda similar to your first job, and each base job
has their own unique choice of 2 2nd jobs. So how does the system do this??? Simple. By the use of 2 simple masks called
Branch Masks. Here they are below...

JOBL_2_1 0x100
JOBL_2_2 0x200

The path you choose for your 2nd job determand which one will be used. If our Swordman chooses to become a Knight, the
2-1 branch mask will be assigned. If he chooses to become a Crusader, he will be given the 2-2 branch mask. The hex value
at the end of the mask is for value for that branch. So we choose a Knight. The system now assigns the 2-1 branch mask and
adds its hex value to your 1st jobs value. So adding hex here, 100 + 01 = 101. So the value is now 101. If he would of
chosen the other job, it would of became 201 insteaed. Note that the 3rd number to the left is the Branch number.

|-Branch MAPID Number (Number 3 to the left)
| - Base MAPID Number (Numbers 1 and 2)
|/|
101

Things get a little more complexed here, so try to keep up with me. The next part has to do with the 3rd jobs.
After fighting many battle and becomeing true and fimilar to your job, your now perty much unstopable, but it doesent end
there. Your now at another split in the path, but this isnt a path where you can choose your next job. Its a decission
were you can choose to proceed straight to your 3rd job, or chose the path that will make you more stronger then the other
path will lead you to. How much stronger the other path will make you will be explained later. Lets focus on how things were
before 3rd jobs existed first.

Orginal when a player would reach level 99, they are given the opition to be reborn to be much stronger and get goodies like
a %25 higher HP/SP MAX, access to stronger skills, a chance to earn 20 extra job points, and access to even more powerful
equips, however theirs a catch. Reborn means being reborn as in, forgeting everything you know and starting fresh as a
novice. Sounds lame doesent it? Well its worth it. Upon being reborn, your givein a special kind of mask called a UPPER mask.

JOBL_UPPER 0x1000

Since your a novice again, you end up with a base value of 0x00 and with the Upper added its brough to a MAPID of 0x1000.
So lets start again. Kill kill kill, yes. You can get your 1st job...again. Note that you dont have choices in jobs like
you did last time. So looks like your following the same path again. HIGH SWORDMAN!!!! High versions of 1st jobs have the
same base MAPID value as their regular versions. So that means your base value is now 0x01 again, and dont forget your
rebornand and have UPPER, so that makes it 0x1001. Kill kill kill kill...yes JOB U...WOA!!! Upon job up to your 2nd job
again you get assigned that same Branch mask, but you look different. Thats because your 2nd class job has been upgraded
to a more powerful version, the Lord Knight. This is where you get access to a wider range of skills on your 2nd job.

So how did you get this job instead? Simple. Its UPPER. Uupper + 2-1 + Swordman. So thats 1000 + 100 + 01 = 1101 MAPID
So this is what you end up with...

  |-- Upper MAPID Number (4th number to the left)
  ||-Branch MAPID Number (3rd number to the left)
  || - Base MAPID Number (1st and 2nd number to the left)
  ||/|
0x1101

Now that you know that, you should also know that theirs a 2nd UPPER mask called JOBL_BABY and has a hex value of 2000.
Currently, haveing Baby for your UPPER mask instead of the Upper will make you a baby charactor. No just because its value
is bigger doesent make them stronger. It just gives them a different job, mainly base versions of 1st and 2nd jobs, but for
babys.

Ok. Cool. Now that we got that out of the way, lets return to that split in the path between 3rd job and being reborn.
If you choose the path of the 3rd job, you become your next job, which will be Rune Knight. So how does the job system
handle the new job? We allready have a Base value, and we allready have a Branch assigned to our MAPID, and its not like
were getting a choice between 2 more jobs or branches. So whats the server to do??? Simple. Assigned it a UPPER to give it
a new MAPID and a new job.

JOBL_THIRD 0x4000

This mask is in charge of all the base versions of 3rd jobs, versions which are after base 2nd jobs. Now remember that we
were a base 2nd job and not reborn when we changed. So were had a MAPID of 101 before, and with this UPPER added, which is
4000 + 101 = 4101 MAPID for the Rune Knight. Their's a total of 13 Job ID's for the base versions of 3rd jobs, as well as
8 for MOUNTS.(5 for each of Rune Knights different colored Dragon mounts, 1 for Royal Guard Gryphon, 1 for Ranger, and 1
for Mechanic's MADO). So this is the end of this path. More skills, better equips, yea you feel stronger, but what if you
wold of taken the path to be reborn??? How would that have helped? Ok lets go back and take it to find out. BACK TRACK!!!!

Ok were no back in time where our charactor was a base 2nd class job, the Knight. So what of that other path??? Well do you
remember what youve read earlier? Ok recall that and lets take that path and fast foward. Your now a Lord Knight again. You
fought hard to get back to your 2nd job to become a stronger version of your 2nd job, but wait.....whats this...you can job
up again??? Yes its true. You can be reborn, get toy our 2nd job, and you can still be a 3rd job. So before changeing into
that 3rd job, lets recall your MAPID, which is 1101. You allready have a UPPER, so how is the server goina change you into
3rd??? Look below...

JOBL_UPPER 0x1000
JOBL_THIRD 0x4000

Your upper mask UPPER is kept and a 2nd upper mask is added, being the same THIRD mask. So you retain the bonuses and skills
from your trans job. Sooo...what does this mean, and why? First off, no this does not mean your 3rd job will be any
different. You will still have access to the same skills, have the same job name, same outfit, yea. So what was the extra
work for? Well the things you did in the past follows on to your 3rd job. Things like you %25 HP/SP MAX increase, trans
skills, and those extra 20 skill points if youve level your job level to 70 before becomeing 3rd. Perty cool huh? Told you
you would end up stronger from chooseing the reborn path.

So now your with a Rune Knight with %25 higher HP/SP MAX then what a non reborn Rune Knight would end up with, PLUS you have
transcendent skills. So its worth the extra work. SOOO, why the different UPPER mask? mainly, the 2 version of each job has
access to different skill trees. One with no trans skills, and one with trans skills. Also UPPER and TRANS_UPPER mask both
give the %25 HP/SP MAX boost, while THIRD doesent. In order for 2 seprate trees to exist, a 2nd set of job ID's is needed
for thr trans versions of 3rd jobs and their mounts.

Makes since doesent it???

Now baby 3rd jobs are slightly different. They perty much use the same bae and branch masks and the same third upper mask.
However, they use the baby and third masks together to give them baby penalitys.

JOBL_BABY 0x2000
JOBL_THIRD 0x4000

===== 2. Simple Example and Explaining =====
Ok if your reading this, then chances are you didnt want to see all the detail. So here goes.

Their's 2 versions of each job. Base and Trans. They both have the same job name, same access range to 3rd job skills, same
job outfit, and same equipment permissions. The only difference is that the trans version has a %25 higher HP/SP MAX then
the base version. Also, the trans version has access to trans skills, while the base version does not. So perty much,
depending on if your job is base 2nd or trans 2nd will determand this. So for reborns, it mainly means that HP/SP bonus and
the trans skills you learn pass on with you to your 3rd job.

Here's a example for a Swordman going for Rune Knight. Top path if he choses to proceed to 3rd, bottom path if he choses
to be reborn.

				  --> Rune Knight
				 /
Novice --> Swordman --> Knight --
				 \
				  --> High Novice --> High Swordman --> Lord Knight --> Rune Knight

Yes the reborn path is longer, but getting that HP/SP MAX boost and trans skills can make all the difference. Plus High
Novice get some extra stat points.

Babys however are forced to move straight to their 3rd jobs since they can be reborn. Below is the flow for a Rune Knight.

Baby Novice --> Baby Swordman --> Knight --> Rune Knight

They cant get any trans abilitys or skills, but they CAN equip trans equips since 3rd jobs are a higher class then 2nd trans.
Even tho their 3rd jobs, they still get the limits that lower baby jobs get, even the -%30 HP/SP max.
