================================

===== 1. 3CeAM 3rd Jobs Item Handleing =====
In 3CeAM, the item database has been edited to allow support for 3rd jobs and also make eAthena's item_db backwords compatible.
This was done to make all existing items compatible with the new jobs without the need to edit any items (except for one with
certain bonus scripts that does job checks), as well as add in support for special 3rd class items and equips.

Lets see how fimilar jobs handle items. Their's 2 things that set what jobs are able to use what item and equips.
The Job masks, and the Upper setting. Their's masks for base 1st and 2nd jobs, as well as some extended jobs, but lets focus
on the regular jobs. By setting a mask for a 1st or 2nd job and giveing a upper of 1, itl work for all jobs. If the
upper setting was set to 2, the item would be accessable to reborns, and all 3rds including 3rd babys, if set to 4, it would be
accessable only to all baby jobs. The need to add numbers together for the upper setting is no longer needed.

So how does 3rd jobs handle items??? Since 3rd jobs use upper masks, they require upper settings as well.

 8: Third Jobs

So how does it know what 3rd job to work for, and which not to work for? Use of job masks. If we wanted to make a
Rune Knight only equip, we would give the item a Knight mask 0x00000080 and a upper of 8. The Knight mask was given to
serve the same purpose as it would serve for a Lord Knight only item. Knight with a upper setting of 2. If we wanted a
Royal Guard only item, we would give the item a Crusader mask 0x00004000 and a upper of 8. Its kinda like the same thing
as makeing a item for a Paladin, but with a different upper setting set.

===== 2. Item Database Edits =====
Ok thats cool. So since these new jobs have their own upper setting, would all of the items in the item_db need to have
their upper setting changed??? The answer is no since its backwords compatible. So you can use the one from eAthena and itl
work, but the only thing to keep a eye on is any bonus scripts that checks for certain jobs.

Example is the poison bottles. That required adding a check for Guillotines.

===== 3. 3rd Jobs Item Database =====
All items for the 3rd jobs have been added to the item_db2.txt file in the database. This makes it easier to add, find, and
edit items. Its strongly recommand you use the item_db2 provided with 3CeAM since we do all our item work in there.

===== 4. New Item Settings =====
These are the new job masks and upper settings added to the item database

Upper: Equippable upper-types. Uses the following bitmasks to set type of job the player
is required to be to beable to use that item:
	1: All existing jobs can use it (All Base, Trans, Babys, and Thirds)
	2: Trans and higher jobs/ Baby Thirds (All Trans, Thirds, and Third Babys)
	4: Babys only (Only baby jobs can use it)
	8: Thirds (Thirds and Third Babys)
