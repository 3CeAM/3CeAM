Questions Needing Answers For 2011 Updates....

Note: Just to toss in here and remember, Frost Nova's freeze chance is incorrectly set.

Note2: Must recheck burning status.

Death Bound
Document says skill cooldown is 3 seconds, yet iRO's skill desc says you must wait 5 seconds before re-casting again.
Which is true?
Also says you cant move for the 2 second duration of the skill. How do I code that in?

Hundred Spear
Past info said that the player must master the Spear Boomerang for the autocast chance to work.
Yet iRO's skill desc says has a chance of activating the highest learned level of [Spear Boomerang] if the caster has learned that skill.
Which is true?

Wind Cutter
Whats the fear status duration?
Is the AoE size really 5x3 or is it 5x5?

Ignition Break
Is the bonus damage from having a fire element weapon equipt applied and affect by your base level, or its seprate?

Dragon Training
Document says size modifiers for spears is 100% for all sizes. Is it really 100% for small size or just medium and large sizes?

Dragon Howling
Is the fear status's immobilization 2 seconds reguardless of how I set fear's duration?

Rune Mastery
Success formula setup will need to be reworked or maybe entirely recoded since theirs much more to the success then just the skill level.
Will do this one day when I have time.

Millennium Shield
Says number of shields summoned: 2 shields at 50% chance, 3 shields at 30% chance, 4 shields at 20% chance.
I dont know if the way we have it coded makes the chances close to this. Right now its coded to work like this....
Chance to get 4 shields =  50% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 3 shields next.
Chance to get 3 shields =  80% <-- If random chance fails, it will try for 2 shields next.
Chance to get 2 shields = 100%
Also says it stuns the player when 1 shield breaks. The stun lasts for 3 seconds and reduced by VIT right? Does this even work in 3CeAM?
May reduce stun duration to 1 second if found that 3 seconds is too high. Imagine a shield breaking back to back every second. COuld be annoying.

Crush Strike
How do I code it as a self cast? I know how to make it self cast, but not how to apply damage through a status.
Guess ill do it like Exeed Break? I only updated the damage formula to official for now.

Refresh
The document doesent say it, but a tester found that it removes and immunes against Decrease AGI and Quagmire. It also worked on
White Imprison but not sure if it still does on it. Its been left in for now.

Vitality Activation
The disabled SP regen part is coded, but how do you code it to increase effectiveness of HP potions, heal skills
and lower effectiveness of SP recovery items?

Storm Blast
Document says nothing about a aftercast, yet past data showed it had a 1 second cooldown. Then again that aftercast found wasnt from kRO.
ill go by what the document said since other things in that old data was inaccurate like Earth Strain's item strip chance.
Note: I do remember it said somewhere in the document for another skill saying the value was changed to nothing.
Maybe I should keep my eyes open for that as that tells if something was removed or set to 0.

Fighting Spirit
The ASPD increase part was set to boost it by 2% * RK_RUNEMASTERY-LV-LEARNED as 10% will give a +4 increase to the base.
But I think the ASPD boost is only working if your in a party, which is incorrect as it should always work.
The code looks complex and im not bothering to fix it. Someone else can do that.

Phantom Thrust
Should work against other players in PVP and duel?

White Imprison
Different success chance on yourself, targeted player, and targeted monster? Different duration on yourself, targeted player, and targeted monster?
Different duration reduction stats between targeted player and targeted monster? Know what....screw it. This is kinda complex and ill work
onthis skill another time when I feel like it or if anyone else wants to do it.

Marsh of Abyss
The skill is coded kinda funky and may need to be recoded. Settings in skill_cast_db was updated but not bothering to do anything else til later.

Sienna Execrate
Also coded in a funky way and will need to be recoded on some parts. Im guessing its coding from the time we were still learning how to code things?
Best come back to this one later.

Radius
I dont understand why the document says it has a cast time, aftercast, and duration when I see no SP requirement in the skillinfolist or any patch
notes saying anything about changes from passive to self cast. Might be a error in their document.

Stasis
Some parts of the code appear to need a cleanup or a recode. Coming back to this later.

Hell Inferno
Is using sc_start4 to activate the burning status. Do it have to be done with that or it could be changed to sc_start safely?

Comet
Splash AoE was changed to 19x19 and the AoE zone sizes and damagesa for each one was updated. Will need to replace the splash with AoE units usage
one day when I get a chance.

Chain Lightning
Damage formula has changed to a interesting one. The formula is (Not including the base level part)....
Formula = 500 + 100 * SkillLV + 100 * ( 9 - Number of Chains Made)
How can I code in the last part to detect how many chains (also called bounces) made?

Earth Strain
Whats its duration for strip status?

Tetra Vortex
This system needs to be reworked and cleaned up. Tetra Vortex's 4 elemental attack ID's are now being used again since a different colored animation
is now triggered from them. The main ID is again used only for casting. You still only need 4 spheres and which ones you summon still determands the
element of each strike.

Summon Sphere's
The damage formula isnt given in the documents but whats in 3CeAM is very close to official. Might recheck it again later if needed.

Reading Spellbook
Says nothing about cooldown time in the document. Does this mean the cooldown was removed?

Fear Breeze
The current way this skill is doing its random number of hits effect is not official and will need to be recoded.
Will do a temp update to the skill for now.

Aimed Bolt
Will need to recheck and redo the size check and percentage on number of hits code.
The number of arrows needed for this skill depends on the number of hits that will be done.

Electric Shocker
Must code in duration reduction formula.
Where is the code for the percent of SP thats drained per second? I cant find it.

Waug Bite
Must code in duration reduction formula and how Tooth of Wug affects things.

Tooth of Waug
Read the info for Waug Bite. Must add that.

Camouflage
Here's a good one....
While in Camouflage, CRIT chance and damage increases by 10% and damage increases by +30 (Fixed) per second respectively. However Ranger’s DEF will decrease by 5% per second.
(CRIT is increased up to 100%, Damage is increased up to +300 (Fixed)
How the hell do I code this to change every second? The duration is 10 seconds tops. So this means that by the end of the duration the DEF will be -50%?
I cant even properly read the movement speed code. Skipping this one for now.

Magenta Trap, Cobalt Trap, Maize Trap, Verdure Trap
Didnt bother to look at or these these. Will one day.
