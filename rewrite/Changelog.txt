03/20/2010
	r263 [Rytech]
	*This is part 1 of a big major update.
	-WARNING!!!! For the next few revisions following this one, the program will be uncompileable due to many checks needing to be redone
	-because of the add in of this update. Update to this revision ONLY if your intrested at looking at the code.

	*Added in the V2.0 3CeAM job system.
	-This system will give better support for many things and also fix and improve on many of the problems weve had in the past.
	-Another update will follow soon to add in some other needed info for the charactor server.
	-This adds support for the 3rd class baby jobs. You can freely test them, but their skills will not appear in the client normally.
	-The item database upper settings are planned on being redone soon as third jobs now only use 1 upper setting.
	-You WILL need a 2010-03-10 RE client or higher to beable to see the baby jobs. XRay may not beable to support baby jobs
	-properly, even if you add them into your tables since the client itself does the sprite shrink trick for baby jobs. (I think)
	-Please do not post any "It wont compile, and it gives errors trying" reports. I am aware of this as many of the checks and features
	-will have to be changed or redone to work with the new system.
