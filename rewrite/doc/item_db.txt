All items are assigned to a ID number and no 2 items can use the same ID.
Highest possiable ID number is 32767.

=Aegis Name
The name of the item as it is in Aegis's database.
This name is used as a reference to the item in NPC scripts and look ups.
Underscores are used since spaces are not allowed in the name.

=Name
The name of the item displayed in english.
This name is used for a displayed output in @ commands and script commands.
Spaces are allowed in this name.

=Type
Sets what kind of item it is.
Each type requires different fields to be used.
The following below are the different usable types....
--------------------------------
0 = Healing Item
2 = Usable Item
3 = Etc Item
4 = Weapon ('View' sets the weapon type.)
5 = Armor ('Loc' sets the armor type and slot it will equip to.)
6 = Card ('Loc' sets what equips the card can be inserted into.)
7 = Pet Egg
8 = Pet Equipment
10 = Ammo ('View' set the ammo type.)
11 = Usable Item With Delayed Consumption (The item is lost from the

18 = Usable Item With Delayed Consumption On Confirm (Works just like
type 11, except the user is required to confirm that he/she wants to
use the item. Mainly used for special packages, boxes, and other cash
shop items.)
--------------------------------

=Buy
The default price of the item when a NPC is selling it to the player.
If a 'Buy' price is not set and their's a 'Sell' price set, the NPC
will sell the item at double the 'Sell' price.
Normally a 'buy' price is set for every existing item in official.

=Sell
The default price of the item when a player is selling it to the NPC.
If a 'Sell' price is not set and their's a 'Buy' price set, the player
will sell the item at half the 'Buy' price.
Normally a 'sell' prices is not set for every existing item in official
since the 'buy' prices handles everything.

=Weight
The weight of the item.
This is required for all item types.
The weight is set in a 1.0 format.
For example, a value of 1 will add 0.1 weight while a value of 10 will
add 1 whole weight (1.0 Weight).

=ATK
The attack of the weapon.
This is only required for weapon type items.
This sets the attack (ATK) of the weapon that will add to the player's
ATK when equipped.

=DEF
The defense of the armor.
This is only required for armor type items.
This sets the defense (DEF) of the armor that will add to the player's
hard DEF when equipped.

=Range
The attack distance of the weapon.
This is only required for weapon type items.
The range is measured as the cell distance between the player and the target.
A range between 1 - 4 will make the weapon deal melee damage, while a range of
5 or higher will make the weapon deal ranged damage.

=Slots
The number of slots a equip has.
This is required for weapon and armor type items.
A number of between 0 - 4 slots can be set to any equippable item.
The slots can be used for placing cards in, as well as enchantment
stones (Correct me if im wrong on the enchantments).
No more then 4 slots can be set.

=Job
Sets which jobs can use or equip the item.
This is required for weapon, armor, and usable type items.
The setting works by adding together the bitmasks for every job you want to have
permission to use the item. The masks below are for regular 1st and 2nd jobs and
their permissions are inherited to their trans/baby versions of the jobs, as
well as all 3rd jobs. 2nd jobs do not inherit permissions from their 1st job unless
noted in the table below. Below is a few examples on how this works....
--------------------------------
Example:
Bitmasks are added together in hex values.
A single hex digit can have a total of 16 different values.
The hex values are 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F.
In decimal that means 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15.
But lets stick to the hex numbers here.

Assassin Only
0x00001000 (Assassin) = 0x00001000

Priest + Monk
0x00000100 (Priest) + 0x00008000 (Monk) = 0x00008100

Blacksmith + Hunter
0x00000400 (Blacksmith) + 0x00000800 (Hunter) = 0x00000C00

Wizard + Sage + Soul Linker
0x00000200 (Wizard) + 0x00010000 (Sage) + 0x00800000 (Soul Linker) = 0x00810200

Knight + Priest+ Wizard + Blacksmith + Hunter + Assassin
0x00000080 (Knight) + 0x00000100 (Priest) + 0x00000200 (Wizard) + 0x00000400 (Blacksmith) +
0x00000800 (Hunter) + 0x00001000 (Assassin) = 0x00001F80
--------------------------------
Regular Jobs Bitmask Table
0x00000001 = Novice/Super Novice (Expanded Super Novice inherits this permission)
0x00000002 = Swordman

0x10000000 = Dark Collector
0x20000000 = Kagerou/Oboro

--------------------------------

=Upper
Sets what versions of a job can use or equip the item.
This is required for weapon, armor, and usable type items.
This setting is similar to how the 'Job' setting works, except this setting
sets what version of a job the player must be playing to beable to use the item.
The 'Job' and 'Upper' settings work together to set the requirements to use the
item and limit them to being usable by certain jobs.
--------------------------------
Example of The Different Versions:
The Knight is the regular 2-1 version of the Swordman and their's
multiple versions of this job, most of which have access to a wider
range of equips by inheriting permissions from the lower versions of its job.
Regular - Normal 2nd Job 2-1 Swordman = Knight
Trans - Reborn 2nd Job 2-1 Swordman = Lord Knight (Inherits Knight's permissions)
Third - 3rd Job of The 2-1 Swordman = Rune Knight (Inherits Knight and Lord Knight permissions)

Same example for the regular 2-2 version of the Swordman.
Regular - Normal 2nd Job 2-2 Swordman = Crusader
Trans - Reborn 2nd Job 2-2 Swordman = Paladin (Inherits Crusader permissions)
Third - 3rd Job of The 2-2 Swordman = Royal Guard (Inherits Crusader and Paladin permissions)

Example On How To Use The Setting:
This is how to set the required version of a certain job the player must be to use the item
by combining the 'Job' and 'Upper' settings.
Setting For Jobs In The Swordman Tree
0x00000080,1 = Knight (Lord Knight and Rune Knight inherits the permission)
0x00000080,2 = Lord Knight (Rune Knight inherits the permission)
0x00000080,8 = Rune Knight
0x00004000,1 = Crusader (Paladin and Royal Guard inherits the permission)
0x00004000,2 = Paladin (Royal Guard inherits the permission)
0x00004000,8 = Royal Guard
--------------------------------
Upper Jobs Table
1 = Regular Jobs (Trans, Baby, and Third inherits this permission)
2 = Trans Jobs (Third inherits this permission)
4 = Baby Jobs
8 = Third Jobs
--------------------------------

=Gender
Sets which gender is allowed to use or equip the item.
This is required for weapon, armor, and usable type items.
This setting is mainly used for restricting the use of instruments/whips to their
proper jobs. Since Bard/Dancer type jobs are both the 2-2 job of the Archer and
both of them use the same 'Job' bitmask, the gender setting is used to set which
gender uses which weapon. Bards use instruments and Dancers use whips.
This setting is used for a few other items like The Tuxedo, Wedding Dress, and
the 2 different Mechanic exclusive headgears (Males get the red one and females
get the yellow one)
--------------------------------
0 = Female
1 = Male
2 = Both
--------------------------------

=Loc
Sets which equip slots weapon/armor will equip into.
Also used to set what weapon/armor piece a card can be inserted into.
This is required for weapon, armor, and card type items.
This setting affects if a weapon will equip in 1 or both hands ('View' setting also
required for setting weapon to 1 or 2 handed behavior) and also sets what kind of
armor piece a item is which also sets what slot or slots it equips to.
Most equip items will use a single slot setting. However, some equips like certain
weapons, headgears, and all accessorys require a combination of 2 or more slot bits
added together. This setting works a little different for cards. When setting for
cards, the setting tells which kinds of equips it can be attached to.
--------------------------------

      1 = Lower Headgear
      2 = Right Hand (Weapon)
      4 = Robe

are scripted. Refinements can also affect the effectiveness of certain skills.
--------------------------------
0 = Not Refineable
1 = Refineable
--------------------------------

=View
Sets the view ID for a item.
Required for weapon, armor, and ammo type items.
This setting serves a number of different functions.
For headgears, shields, costume headgears, and costume robes, the setting sets which sprite
will appear when the item is equipped. Which range of sprites you can select from depends on
the equip location thats set to the item. Example being items equipped on the head will display
headgear sprites, shield equips will display shields, and costume robes will display special
sprites on the back. The setting works different for weapons and ammo. For weapon equips,
the view setting will set what type of weapon the equip is and also set the correct weapon
sprite for the weapon. For ammo, the view setting sets the ammo type.
